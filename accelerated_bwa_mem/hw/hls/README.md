- The top level components of the project are implemented in HDL (VHDL/Verilog).
- However these can instantiate HLS components.
- Each instantiated HLS components has to be the top level components of its own HLS project.
    - Define the top level function as WRAPPER in the Makefile
    - add all required sources to the Makefile
